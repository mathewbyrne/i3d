This is an old 3D graphics programming assignment from 2006.  The assignment was 
to draw a 3D bird and have it animate in various positions.  It's written in 
fairly neat ANSI C, and depends on your system having:

- OpenGL
- GLUT
- libpng (& libz)

This is currently setup to compile under OS X using clang as it's compiler.  The code
will compile fine under Linux but will require all the header paths, lib paths etc to
be updated.
